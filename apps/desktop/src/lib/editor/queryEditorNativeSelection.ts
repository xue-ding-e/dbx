/**
 * macOS 26/27 asks the web view to serialize the browser selection into an
 * attributed string whenever the pointer dwells over text services (the
 * Writing Tools check that follows a text selection). Resolving that string
 * means a colour lookup per styled run, so one request over a few hundred
 * highlighted lines of SQL costs well over 100 ms of web process main thread
 * time — and while one of the app's own menus sits on top of the selection
 * every pointer move over that menu asks again, which saturates the main
 * thread and makes right click, Esc and the whole window feel frozen.
 *
 * The browser selection does not have to cover the selection for the editor to
 * behave: CodeMirror paints the selection itself (`drawSelection` keeps the
 * native one transparent), it copies from its own state, and it ignores a
 * selection parked outside its content element. So the browser selection is
 * parked on the editor chrome while an overlay menu covers the editor, and for
 * as long as a pointer gesture is dragging a long selection out, and restored
 * as soon as the menu closes or the pointer is released. On macOS desktop a
 * view plugin also holds long keyboard selections, including during execution.
 * Its collapsed caret stays inside the editable so native input without a
 * keydown still arrives. The observer cache is updated together with that caret
 * so CodeMirror does not mistake the parked position for a user selection.
 *
 * The drag is the case that is easiest to misread from a bug report: sweeping
 * the pointer to the edge of the editor autoscrolls and never leaves the
 * pointer on the text, so it stays smooth, while moving back up into the
 * already selected lines pays the serialization cost on every mouse move
 * (smooth in Chrome/Blink, which does not make that request at all).
 *
 * Parking outside `contentDOM` is what makes CodeMirror leave the editor state
 * alone (it maps a foreign selection back to the selection it already has), so
 * the parked selection stays where it is, but it also means CodeMirror's own
 * `copy`/`cut` handler declines the event — see `handleParkedClipboardEvent`,
 * which supplies the clipboard text in that window.
 */

 * Selections shorter than this are serialized cheaply enough that parking them
