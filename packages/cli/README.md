# DBX CLI

Command line interface for DBX database connections, schema inspection, safe queries, and prompt-ready schema context.

## Install

### npm

```bash
npm install -g @dbx-app/cli
```

### Homebrew

```bash
brew tap t8y2/tap
brew install dbx-cli
```

The npm package installs the native CLI for the current platform automatically. Node.js 18.18.0 or newer is only needed for the npm launcher; direct native distributions do not require Node.js.

### Native downloads

The `packages-v*` GitHub Release also provides standalone native CLI archives:

| Platform | Archive |
| --- | --- |
| macOS Apple Silicon | `dbx-cli-darwin-arm64.tar.gz` |
| macOS Intel | `dbx-cli-darwin-x64.tar.gz` |
| Linux glibc ARM64 | `dbx-cli-linux-arm64-gnu.tar.gz` |
| Linux glibc x64 | `dbx-cli-linux-x64-gnu.tar.gz` |
| Windows ARM64 | `dbx-cli-win32-arm64.zip` |
| Windows x64 | `dbx-cli-win32-x64.zip` |

Verify the downloaded archive with `CLI-SHA256SUMS`, extract it, and run the native binary directly:

```bash
tar -xzf dbx-cli-linux-x64-gnu.tar.gz
chmod +x dbx
./dbx --version
./dbx connections list --json
```

Standalone binaries do not require Node.js. They read the same DBX connection storage as the desktop application; set `DBX_DATA_DIR` when using a custom or portable data directory.

## Official Agent Skill

The CLI binary includes the official DBX Skill for shell-capable AI agents. Enable it once after installing or upgrading the CLI:

```bash
dbx agent setup
dbx agent status
```

The default location is `~/.agents/skills/dbx`. `setup` runs entirely offline and can be repeated to install a newer bundled version. It refuses to overwrite an unmanaged or locally modified DBX Skill unless `--force` is supplied. Use `--skills-dir <path>` when the agent reads a different skills root.

## Usage

```bash
dbx doctor
dbx capabilities
dbx agent setup
dbx agent status --json
dbx connections list --json
dbx connections list --format csv
dbx schema list local --json
dbx schema describe local users --json
dbx query local "select count(*) as total from users" --json
dbx query local "select id, name from users" --format csv
dbx query local "select * from users" --limit 50 --timeout 10s --json
dbx query local --file ./query.sql --json
dbx context local --tables users,orders
dbx open local users
```

## Output

Use `--json` or `--format json` for stable machine-readable output. Use `--format csv` for query, connection, and schema data that should be piped into other command line tools.

Errors are written to stderr and return a non-zero exit code.

## Query Controls

`dbx query` is read-only by default.

Use `--limit <n>` to control returned query rows and `--timeout <duration>` to control query timeout. Durations accept `ms`, `s`, or `m`, such as `500ms`, `10s`, or `1m`.

Use `--allow-writes` for non-dangerous write statements. Dangerous SQL such as `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, and `ALTER` requires both `--allow-writes` and `--allow-dangerous-sql`.

For SQL that starts with a dash, pass `--` before the SQL:

```bash
dbx query local --json -- "-- comment
select 1"
```

## Default Connection

Set `DBX_CONNECTION` to omit the connection name for query and context commands:

```bash
DBX_CONNECTION=local dbx query "select 1" --json
DBX_CONNECTION=local dbx context --tables users,orders
```

## Desktop App Requirements

Some CLI commands can run without DBX Desktop:

- `connections list`
- `schema list`
- `schema describe`
- `query`
- `context`

Direct execution supports PostgreSQL/Redshift, MySQL-compatible databases (MySQL, Doris, StarRocks), and SQLite. Other database types use the DBX Desktop bridge or DBX Agent/JDBC infrastructure.

Use `dbx doctor` to check whether the DBX connection database, connection table, native SQLite loader, and desktop bridge are available. Use `dbx capabilities` to list direct-query and bridge-required database types.

If the optional platform package was not installed, reinstall without `--no-optional`:

```bash
npm uninstall -g @dbx-app/cli
npm install -g @dbx-app/cli
```

The native CLI does not require `better-sqlite3` and is not coupled to the Node.js ABI.

## Error Codes

CLI JSON errors use stable codes:

| Code                     | Meaning                                             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `UNKNOWN_OPTION`         | An unsupported flag was provided                    |
| `INVALID_OPTION`         | A flag is missing a value or has an invalid value   |
| `INVALID_ARGUMENT`       | Positional arguments are missing or conflicting     |
| `CONNECTION_STORE_ERROR` | DBX connection storage exists but could not be read |
| `CONNECTION_NOT_FOUND`   | No DBX connection matched the requested name        |
| `SQL_BLOCKED`            | SQL safety rules blocked execution                  |
| `DBX_NOT_RUNNING`        | DBX Desktop bridge is unavailable                   |
| `HOME_NOT_FOUND`         | The default user skills directory cannot be resolved |
| `SKILL_MODIFIED`         | An unmanaged or locally edited DBX Skill was found  |
| `SKILL_PATH_UNSAFE`      | A managed Skill path is a symbolic link             |
| `SKILL_READ_FAILED`      | An installed Skill file could not be read            |
| `SKILL_WRITE_FAILED`     | The bundled Skill could not be installed             |
| `ERROR`                  | Unexpected runtime failure                          |

## Codex

Codex can call the CLI directly from shell tools:

```bash
dbx schema describe local users --json
dbx context local --tables users,orders | codex exec "Write a retention query"
```

## Manage saved connections

These commands edit DBX connection configuration, without connecting to or modifying the database. Local mode requires an initialized DBX encrypted store and access to its existing key; these commands do not provision keys or bypass the data security upgrade. They share Desktop's encrypted storage and also work with `DBX_WEB_URL` when the Web server supports the update endpoint. All commands respect MCP connection/tool scope; mutations are blocked by global MCP read-only mode and scoped AI sessions. Configure access in **DBX Settings → MCP**. `--allow-writes` cannot override that policy for connection management.

```bash
dbx connections list --json
dbx connections get <id-or-name> --json
dbx connections add --file connection.json --json
dbx connections update <id-or-name> --file changes.json --json
dbx connections remove <id-or-name> --yes --json
```

Use a connection ID when names are ambiguous. `list` includes IDs and `read_only`; `get` returns supported settings without passwords, tokens, DSNs, URL parameters, scripts or tunnel/plugin secrets. Output is intentionally not a credential backup.

Create an owner-only JSON file (`chmod 600 connection.json` on Unix; restrict its ACL on Windows) using a secure editor, or pipe JSON from a credential manager with `--file -`. Terminal stdin is rejected to avoid echoing credentials. Do not place passwords in shell command arguments, history, inline JSON, or source-controlled files. The CLI has no password command-line flag. JSON input is limited to 1 MiB; errors never echo invalid input values.

Minimal `connection.json` without credentials:

```json
{"name":"scratch","db_type":"sqlite","host":"/absolute/path/scratch.db","port":0,"read_only":true}
```

Add accepts `name`, `db_type`, `host`, optional `port`, `username`, `password`, `database`, `ssl`, `driver_profile`, `read_only`, and `save_password`. Ports default to the database manifest when available; specify `0` for file databases.

Example `changes.json`:

```json
{"name":"scratch-renamed","read_only":false,"query_timeout_secs":60}
```

Update accepts `name`, `note`, `host`, `port`, `username`, `password`, `database`, `driver_profile`, `ssl`, `read_only`, `save_password`, `is_production`, `connect_timeout_secs`, `query_timeout_secs`, `idle_timeout_secs`, and `keepalive_interval_secs`. Omitted fields stay unchanged, including every saved credential and driver-specific setting. IDs and database types are immutable. Unsupported fields are rejected.

- `{"password":""}` explicitly clears the saved database password; omission preserves it
- `{"database":null}` or `{"driver_profile":null}` clears that optional setting; other fields do not accept null
- `{"save_password":false}` removes the saved database password; switching back to true does not recover it
- Changing connection settings invalidates cached connections and pinned transactions, so reconnect afterward
- Removal requires `--yes`, deletes the saved connection and its credentials, and cannot be undone by the CLI. Review the target first. Database files/data are untouched. Keep an authorized DBX backup if recovery is needed
